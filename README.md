# Image_Classification_using_Transfer_Learning

We are implementing transfer learning using Keras and VGG model. VGG stands for Visual Geometry Group; it is a standard deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with multiple layers. The VGG architecture is the basis of ground-breaking object recognition models.

## What is the advantage of VGG16?

VGG16 is object detection and classification algorithm which is able to classify 1000 images of 1000 different categories with 92.7% accuracy. It is one of the popular algorithms for image classification and is easy to use with transfer learning.
